## Why _The Reef Log_ ?

As a reef hobbyist, I’ve tried everything from Excel to paid apps, yet nothing met my needs. Most tools were clunky or lacked essential features, leading me to stop logging parameters altogether—a risky move for any reef keeper.

Here’s what I wanted in a logging tool:

- **Modern Design:** Clean, intuitive, and optimized for both desktop and mobile.
- **Comprehensive Insights:** At-a-glance summaries and detailed trend tracking.
- **Cross-Device Accessibility:** No more app clutter! Just open your browser and go.
- **Data Ownership:** Full control to export your logs whenever you want.
- **Rich Context:** Add notes to each log for better insights.
- **Multi-Aquarium Support:** Manage multiple tanks with ease.
- **Active Development:** Continuous improvements driven by community feedback.
- **Reef-Specific Features:** Predefined parameters and ranges tailored for reef aquariums.

I also wanted to make this project open source. As hobbyists, we collectively gather thousands of data points each week. By aggregating and anonymizing this data, we could contribute to valuable scientific research and help the global reef-keeping community.

## What’s Next?

This is just the beginning! Your feedback will be crucial in shaping _The Reef Log_ into the ultimate reef aquarium management tool.

Thank you for your support, and happy reefing!
